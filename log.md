# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 04, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added logic to change background color and make label text content match the new color value.

**Thoughts:** Watching too much tutorials makes the fact of coding without guidance really uncomfortable for me. That's why i want to start that challenge with small projects that i can manage and research on my own. Today i researched the basics of using DOM plus some tips about module (wasn't necessary but i felt eager to use modules and following that impulse felt like a nice idea) and managed to code the main logic of color flip the document's background color. It wasn't hard but took me more time than i expected. If anything i wish this challenge helps me getting a little faster at coding.
