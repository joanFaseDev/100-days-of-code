# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: April 04, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Added logic to change background color and make label text content match the new color value.

**Thoughts:** Watching too much tutorials makes the fact of coding without guidance really uncomfortable for me. That's why i want to start that challenge with small projects that i can manage and research on my own. Today i researched the basics of using DOM plus some tips about module (wasn't necessary but i felt eager to use modules and following that impulse felt like a nice idea) and managed to code the main logic of color flip the document's background color. It wasn't hard but took me more time than i expected. If anything i wish this challenge helps me getting a little faster at coding.

### Day 1: April 05, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Added logic to switch color systems, to initialize a random background color when document is refreshed and to change the document's font color based on the overall intensity of the documen's background color. Also gave the document a proper styling.

**Thoughts:** I ended up spending more time on this project than initially planed because i wanted to add features that were new to me but felt manageable (converting hex colors into rgb ones, adapting font color to background's color overall intensity, ...). I think this 'let's try and we'll see' state of mind is something i want to develop during this challenge. I'll make a ton of mistakes that way and mistakes are good because you can learn from them. 
This project is now finished, i'm satisfied with the result and will take some time today to plan tomorrow's next project.

### Day 2: April 06, 2023

**Today's Progress:** I made a counter using vanilla JavaScript. A simple app where one can increment, decrement or reset the counter (by clicking on it). I added a very basic styling that automatically switch according to the counter being lesser or not to zero.

**Thoughts:** The whole project was basic, just simple DOM manipulation and a little bit of styling. I learned how to access CSS variables from JavaScript which is something i never tried before. Even if i knew where i was going with this app it still took me a couple of hours to finish it. Probably because i have a tendancy to try and read things along the way. I don't think that's a problem, i'll get faster with practice. What's important is consistency and trying new things. Tomorrow will bring both.

### Day 3: April 07, 2023

**Today's Progress:** I started an application taking a user input and checking if it's a palindrome, using vanilla JavaScript. The JavaScript part is as good as finished. I added a palindrome generator, mainly to help me debug my code, but ended up leaving it to help users lacking imagination (like me).

**Thoughts:** A few weeks ago, i wrote a function checking palindrome for codewars.com so i thought this project was going to be easy. Turn out i was wrong, my lack of knowledge on regular expressions cost me a lot of time and errors. Plus i used HTML elements i'm not familiar with like **details**, **summary** and **blockquote**, i had to double check on https://www.w3.org/ that i was using them properly. It was frustrating because i spend a lot of time reading when actually what i really wanted was to code. Which is stupid. Reading documentation/tutorial/guide is part of the learning curve and i'm clearly in the wrong for thinking that the time spend on it isn't worth it. I need to take my time and consolidate what i learn every day. Tortoise and hare, tortoise and hare...

### Day 4: April 08, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Added stylesheet to the project plus some minor JavaScript corrections.

**Thoughts:** I finished the palindrome checker application and am pretty happy with the result. I experimented a bit with CSS and ended up using a cursive font for the app because it suited the theme. Usually i'm careful with this kind of font because if it is often pretty to look at it's also often 'unreadable'. I chose a font that in my opinion take the best of the two worlds. I only know the basics about CSS but for now it's enough. I don't want to try complicated animations yet because i want my main focus to stay on functionnality, not on render. I'll probably take some time to experiment with flexbox though, i think it's an incredible tool which can help create great layouts with little knowledge.

### Day 5: April 09, 2023

**Today's Progress:** I started a To do List application using vanilla JavaScript. Html and JavaScript parts are almost done, currently one can create as many entries as needed, each entry can be cleared (meaning it is done) or removed (meaning one is giving up on it) throught its associated pair of buttons. I also included a random task generator for debug purpose.

**Thoughts:** I did a to do list a couple of months ago. It is a simple project but it requires basic understanding of the DOM, that's why i wanted to redo it before tackling bigger projects. That being said, i tried to add some features to push myself and refactor where it was possible. One of those features is the ability to drag and drop entries of the list. I just started reading MDN about it but i'm gonna try to implement it on this project. I feel pretty enthusiastic about it because it's completely new to me.
