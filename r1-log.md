# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 04, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Added logic to change background color and make label text content match the new color value.

**Thoughts:** Watching too much tutorials makes the fact of coding without guidance really uncomfortable for me. That's why i want to start that challenge with small projects that i can manage and research on my own. Today i researched the basics of using DOM plus some tips about module (wasn't necessary but i felt eager to use modules and following that impulse felt like a nice idea) and managed to code the main logic of color flip the document's background color. It wasn't hard but took me more time than i expected. If anything i wish this challenge helps me getting a little faster at coding.

### Day 1: April 04, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Added logic to switch color systems, to initialize a random background color when document is refreshed and to change the document's font color based on the overall intensity of the documen's background color. Also gave the document a proper styling.

**Thoughts:** I ended up spending more time on this project than initially planed because i wanted to add features that were new to me but felt manageable (converting hex colors into rgb ones, adapting font color to background's color overall intensity, ...). I think this 'let's try and we'll see' state of mind is something i want to develop during this challenge. I'll make a ton of mistakes that way and mistakes are good because you can learn from them. 
This project is now finished, i'm satisfied with the result and will take some time today to plan tomorrow's next project.
